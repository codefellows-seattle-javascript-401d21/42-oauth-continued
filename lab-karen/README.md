## 42-sorting-algorithms
This repo contains a mergeSort that returns a sorted copy of the input array, a quicksort that mutates the input array and a mergeSort that mutates the input array to sort in place.

### Mutate Merge Sort's input array
 Implement a version of Merge Sort that mutates the input array.

### Testing
- Write a test function that generates an array of N random integers
- Write a test function that asserts an array is sorted (based on your sorting implementation)
- Test each sort against an empty array, single-element array, small array, medium array and a large array (1,000 - 10,000 items).
