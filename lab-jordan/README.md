# Radix Sorting Algorithm

### Overview

this module will take in an array and an optional base (base 10 by default). Using the Radix sort, the module will return the array once it is sorted.

### How It Works

Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. This sorting algorithm performs with a best time complexity of O(n log n).
