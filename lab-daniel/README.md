# Sorting Algorithms Lab 42

* Merge Sort - This sorting algorithm works through the concept of divide and conquer by splitting an array into smaller arrays until it reaches a single index values then sorting them appropriately as it merges the arrays back together. The implimentation built during lecture was O(n) space and as per the assignment I have altered the code into O(1) space.
